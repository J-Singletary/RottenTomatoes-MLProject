# COGS118A Project - Training a Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Rotten Tomatoes Scores

In this project we used a dataset containing features of 18,000 different movies on Rotten Tomatoes to predict if a movie is "Fresh" or "Rotten" based on the genre, runtime, release date, and content rating of the movie. 

We trained several classifiers including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest and compared their effectiveness in classifying movies as Fresh or Rotten. 

In the end Linear Regression was the most successful algorithm for our dataset, with a precision score of 76.2%. That means the classifier was able to correctly identify a movie as being "Fresh" almost 80% of the time just based on the four features we looked at.
